This code base contains MATLAB code that solve nonlinear optimization problems, i.e. "solvers", 
that are particularly suited for large scale optimization and inverse problems.
The repo has not been professionally set up for others to use, and 
may also contain dependencies from other repos that I own.
Often, the dependencies are contained within my "utilities" repo.
